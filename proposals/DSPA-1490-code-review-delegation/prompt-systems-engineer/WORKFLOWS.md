## Workflow: Master Heartbeat Orchestrator

**Objective:** Manage Workflow Issue lifecycle for all registered periodic workflows before processing assigned tasks. Creates, resumes, or skips Workflow Issues based on trigger conditions and deduplication rules.
**Trigger:** Every heartbeat, after Step 0 passes, before Standard Heartbeat Procedure.
**Preconditions:** Instruction Validation Gate passed. Workflow label exists (id: `3b18b6d1-385b-48c2-8660-68b66433e9ec`).
**Inputs:** Workflow Registry Table, Paperclip API access, company ID.

### Checklist

- [ ] Step 1: Query existing Workflow Issues — `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?labelId=3b18b6d1-385b-48c2-8660-68b66433e9ec&status=todo,in_progress,done&assigneeAgentId={self}` — Evidence: issue list returned
- [ ] Step 2 (LOOP — each periodic workflow in Registry):
  - Check trigger condition (cadence gate: compare current date against last execution)
  - IF not triggered: skip, log "skipped: cadence not met"
  - IF triggered AND matching Workflow Issue exists (match by workflow name in title + current period): resume it
  - IF triggered AND no matching issue: create new Workflow Issue via `POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues` with:
    - Title: `{Workflow Name} - {Period}` (e.g., "Skill Assignment Hygiene Check - 2026-04")
    - Labels: Workflow (`3b18b6d1-385b-48c2-8660-68b66433e9ec`) + Scheduled (`b87aa6aa-482e-4856-acde-40ed817d4360`) for periodic workflows without a parent
    - Description: **FULL workflow content from WORKFLOWS.md — mechanically copied, not regenerated.**
      Copy procedure:
      (a) Use the Read tool to load your own WORKFLOWS.md file.
      (b) Locate the target workflow section by its heading (pattern: `## Workflow: {Name}` or `### Workflow: {Name}`).
      (c) Extract from that heading through to the next horizontal rule (`---` or `***`) or the next workflow heading at the same or higher level — whichever comes first.
      (d) Use that exact extracted text as the issue description. Do NOT regenerate or summarize from memory.
      (e) **Post-creation validation:** After creating the Workflow Issue, re-read its description via `GET /api/issues/{id}` and verify these 9 section headers are ALL present: Objective, Trigger, Preconditions, Inputs, Mermaid Diagram, Checklist, Validation, Blocked/Escalation, Exit Criteria. If any are missing, immediately PATCH the description with the complete text from step (c).
    - Assignee: self
    - Goal: inherit from parent task if applicable
    - Parent: triggering task (if task-triggered) or none (if periodic/scheduled)
  - Execute workflow steps within the Workflow Issue context
  - IF matching issue exists with status `done` for current period: skip (already completed)
  - On completion: `PATCH /api/issues/{id}` with status `done` (do NOT set `hiddenAt` — hidden issues are invisible to API queries and break dedup)
  - Loop rule: inline checklist (PSE has 1 periodic workflow)
  - Evidence: per-workflow action (created/resumed/skipped)
- [ ] Step 3: Proceed to Standard Heartbeat Procedure for assigned task work — Evidence: handoff complete

### Validation
- Workflow Issues created with correct label, title format, and assignee
- No duplicate Workflow Issues for same workflow + period
- Completed Workflow Issues remain visible (status=done, NO hiddenAt) for audit trail and dedup

### Blocked / Escalation
- If Workflow label missing or deleted: recreate it via `POST /api/companies/{companyId}/labels`, then continue
- If API issues prevent Workflow Issue creation: log error, proceed to Standard Heartbeat (do not block assigned work)

### Exit Criteria
- All periodic workflows checked — Workflow Issues created, resumed, or skipped as appropriate
- Handoff to Standard Heartbeat Procedure complete

---

## Workflow: Standard Heartbeat Procedure

**Objective:** Execute the full heartbeat cycle from identity through work to exit. Runs after the Master Heartbeat Orchestrator has processed periodic workflows.
**Trigger:** Every heartbeat, after Master Heartbeat Orchestrator completes.
**Preconditions:** Instruction Validation Gate passed. Periodic workflows handled.
**Inputs:** Paperclip environment variables, assigned tasks.

### Checklist

- [ ] Step 1: Call GET /api/agents/me — get id, companyId, role, chainOfCommand — Evidence: identity loaded
- [ ] Step 2: Load dspot-company-rules skill — Evidence: rules available in context
- [ ] Step 3: Check PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON and PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID
  - IF `dependency_resolved`: set dependency-wake flag, record `PAPERCLIP_LINKED_ISSUE_IDS`
  - IF mention-triggered: fetch and respond to the triggering comment first
  - IF comment asks to take task: self-assign via checkout
  - IF comment asks for input only: respond in comments, continue
- [ ] Step 4: Call GET /api/agents/me/inbox-lite — Evidence: inbox response received
- [ ] Step 4b: Board-assignment guard — For each issue in inbox, check if `assigneeUserId` is set (board-assigned). Board-assigned issues are always blocked per company rules.
  - IF `assigneeUserId` is set AND `assigneeAgentId` is null: issue is board-assigned
    - Do NOT attempt to checkout or work on it
    - Skip it during work selection (treat as blocked)
    - IF status is not already `blocked`: flag in exit comment as anomaly (board-assigned but not blocked)
  - IF `assigneeUserId` is set AND `assigneeAgentId` is also set: normal agent assignment, process normally
  - Evidence: board-assigned issues identified and skipped
- [ ] Step 4c: Dependency re-evaluation (IF `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON=dependency_resolved`)
  - IF task status is NOT `blocked`: skip (task already unblocked by different path)
  - Fetch `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` task dependencies: `GET /api/issues/{taskId}/dependencies`
  - Check each dependency's status (resolved = blocker issue status is `done` or `cancelled`)
  - IF all dependencies resolved:
    - `PATCH /api/issues/{taskId}` with `{"status": "todo", "comment": "All blocker dependencies resolved. Unblocking task.\n\nResolved: [list of resolved issue links]"}`
    - Include `X-Paperclip-Run-Id` header
    - Prioritize this task for work this heartbeat
  - IF some dependencies remain unresolved:
    - `POST /api/issues/{taskId}/comments` with acknowledgment of partial resolution
    - Keep task `blocked`; do NOT prioritize for work
  - Evidence: Dependencies checked, task transitioned or comment posted
- [ ] Step 5: Pick work — prioritize in_progress, then todo, skip blocked unless unblockable
  - IF PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID set and assigned to me: prioritize it
  - IF nothing assigned and no mention handoff: exit heartbeat
- [ ] Step 6: Call POST /api/issues/{id}/checkout with run ID header — Evidence: checkout success
  - IF 409 Conflict: skip task, never retry
- [ ] Step 7: Call GET /api/issues/{id}/heartbeat-context — read context, ancestors, comments
- [ ] Step 8: Execute domain work (see domain workflows below)
- [ ] Step 9: Update issue status via PATCH /api/issues/{id} with comment — Evidence: status updated
  - Set to `in_review` (not `done`) for completed domain work, with review-ready evidence in the comment. Use `done` only for housekeeping tasks (per Task Completion and Review Handoff rule)
  - IF setting `in_review` for work with a PR: the comment MUST include a wake-triggering mention of `[@DevSecFinOps Engineer](agent://ce6f0942-0925-4d84-a99f-aca6943effbe)` for code quality review. The `agent://` URI triggers the heartbeat wake. Profile links (`/DSPA/agents/...`) do NOT trigger wakes. For non-PR deliverables or escalation, identify the reviewer from `chainOfCommand`.
  - IF blocked: set status to blocked with blocker explanation before exiting
  - IF blocked AND blocker is another issue: include `Blocked-By: [ISSUE-ID](/DSPA/issues/ISSUE-ID)` on its own line per Dependency Declaration rule
  - IF blocked AND blocker is review/human-action (not an issue): describe in prose, do NOT use `Blocked-By:` format
- [ ] Step 9a: Dependency resolution notification (when marking issue done) — Evidence: resolution comments posted or "no dependents found"
  - Search for blocked issues that reference this issue in a `Blocked-By:` line
  - IF found: post a comment on each: `Blocker resolved: [ISSUE-ID](/DSPA/issues/ISSUE-ID) is now done.`
  - IF not found: log "no dependents found" in evidence
- [ ] Step 9b: Full task accounting — Evidence: exit comment posted with all-task disposition
  - **Full task accounting rule:** The final exit comment (on the primary worked task or as a standalone summary) MUST list EVERY assigned task from the inbox with its disposition:
    - **Progressed:** what was done this heartbeat and what remains
    - **Deferred:** explicitly state why (time constraint, deprioritized, dependency not met)
    - **Blocked:** blocker details and who needs to act
    - **Not started:** state reason (new assignment not yet reached, lower priority)
  - **Honest language rule:** Never use "all tasks addressed", "complete", or "done" unless tasks are literally finished (status=done) or explicitly blocked. Use precise language: "progressed", "deferred", "not started this heartbeat"
- [ ] Step 9c: **Stale `in_review` escalation** — During inbox scanning, if any task you own has been in `in_review` for more than 12 hours with no manager acknowledgment (no comment or status change), post a follow-up comment tagging the Technical Lead. Do NOT change the status — leave it as `in_review`. If no response after a second 12-hour window, escalate per the Escalation Protocol (Severity 2). — Evidence: Stale in_review items flagged or "none stale"
- [ ] Step 10: Extract facts to PARA memory via para-memory-files skill — Evidence: daily note updated

### Validation
- Manual check: comment posted on all in_progress tasks before exit
- Manual check: exit summary accounts for every assigned task in inbox (none silently omitted)
- If `dependency_resolved` wake: dependency re-evaluation completed with correct status transition

### Blocked / Escalation
- If blocked: PATCH status to blocked, comment with blocker details and who needs to act
- Escalate via chainOfCommand (Technical Lead first, then Director)

### Exit Criteria
- All in_progress tasks have an exit comment
- Status updates posted for all worked tasks
- Task status set to `in_review` for completed domain work (not `done`). `done` used only for housekeeping tasks.
- When setting `in_review` for PR work: comment includes wake-triggering mention of `[@DevSecFinOps Engineer](agent://ce6f0942-0925-4d84-a99f-aca6943effbe)` for code review. For non-PR deliverables, mention reviewer from `chainOfCommand`
- Exit summary includes disposition for every assigned task (no omissions)
- If `dependency_resolved` wake: blocked task transitioned to `todo` (all deps resolved) or kept `blocked` with partial-resolution comment
