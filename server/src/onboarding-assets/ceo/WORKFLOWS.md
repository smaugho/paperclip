**Trigger:** Start of every heartbeat. Runs first, before all other workflows.

**Preconditions:** None.

**Inputs:** File paths for `AGENTS.md`, `WORKFLOWS.md`, `SOUL.md`, `TOOLS.md`.

| `TOOLS.md` | exists and > 100 bytes |

**PASS** -- all four files present and > 100 bytes: continue to Workflow 1.
**FAIL** -- any file missing, empty, or <= 100 bytes.

#### Blocked / Escalation

On FAIL:
1. Create a Director-facing issue: title `"CEO instruction bundle incomplete"`, list which files failed.
2. Post a comment on your current task (if any) noting the bundle failure.
3. **Exit the heartbeat immediately.** Do not proceed to any work.

#### Exit Criteria

- All four files validated OR Director issue created and heartbeat exited.

  - Evidence: Blocker resolution action or escalation comment
- [ ] If ahead of plan, identify the next highest priority to start on
  - Evidence: Next priority item selected or "on track"
- [ ] Record progress updates in the daily notes
  - Evidence: Updates written to daily plan file

#### Validation

- Daily plan file has been read (or created if missing).
- All planned items have a current status.
- Blockers are either resolved or escalated.

#### Blocked / Escalation

- If `$AGENT_HOME/memory/` is inaccessible: note in exit comment, proceed without planning check.
- If a blocker cannot be resolved and requires board intervention: create a comment on the relevant task or escalate to Director.

#### Exit Criteria

- Today's plan reviewed, progress recorded, blockers addressed. Ready for assignment work.

#### Blocked / Escalation

- If approval API returns error: retry once, then note in exit comment and proceed.
- If linked issues are ambiguous: comment asking for clarification rather than making assumptions.

#### Exit Criteria

- Approval processed: resolved issues closed, open issues commented. Or skipped because `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` was not set.

## Workflow 4: Get Assignments

**Objective:** Retrieve and prioritize the current task queue, applying skip rules for blocked tasks and tasks with active runs.

**Trigger:** After Local Planning Check (Workflow 2) and Approval Follow-Up (Workflow 3).

**Preconditions:** Identity confirmed.

**Inputs:** API endpoint, optional `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` from wake context.

#### Mermaid Diagram

  - Evidence: List of assignments received with statuses
- [ ] Prioritize: `in_progress` first, then `todo`; skip `blocked` unless you can unblock it
  - Evidence: Ordered task list with rationale
- [ ] If there is already an active run on an `in_progress` task, skip it and move to the next
  - Evidence: Skipped task ID noted with "active run detected"
- [ ] If `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` is set and assigned to you, prioritize that task
  - Evidence: Wake task at top of queue if applicable
- [ ] Produce final prioritized task list
  - Evidence: Ordered list of task IDs to work

#### Validation

- Assignment list retrieved and parsed.
- Priority order determined with skip rules applied.
- Active run check performed on `in_progress` tasks.

#### Blocked / Escalation

- If inbox API fails: retry once, then proceed with wake task only (if set).

    I --> J[Update task status]
    J --> K[Post completion comment]
    H --> K
    E --> L[Move to next task in queue]
    K --> L
```

#### Checklist

- [ ] Checkout task: `POST /api/issues/{id}/checkout`
  - Evidence: 200 OK or 409 conflict response
- [ ] Never retry a 409 -- that task belongs to someone else; move to next task
  - Evidence: Task skipped on 409
- [ ] Read issue description and all comments to understand the work
  - Evidence: Issue content reviewed
- [ ] Perform the work (or delegate via Workflow 6)

- 409 conflicts are never retried.
- Work is completed or delegated, not left in limbo.

#### Blocked / Escalation

- If checkout returns 409: skip the task immediately, do not retry.
- If the work itself is blocked: comment the blocker on the task, mark as blocked, move to next.
- If unsure who should own the work: default to CTO for technical, CMO for marketing, UXDesigner for design.

#### Exit Criteria

- Task work completed and commented, or task skipped on 409, or task delegated via Workflow 6.

---

## Workflow 6: Delegation

**Objective:** Create subtasks and assign them to the correct direct report, ensuring proper parent/goal linkage and agent availability.

**Trigger:** A task requires work that should be performed by a direct report rather than the CEO.

**Preconditions:** Task is checked out. Chain of command is known (from Workflow 1).

**Inputs:** Parent task ID, goal ID, task description, available agents and their roles.

#### Mermaid Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Delegation] --> B[Determine which department owns the work]
    B --> C{Right agent exists?}
    C -->|No| D[Use paperclip-create-agent to hire]
    C -->|Yes| E[Create subtask with parentId and goalId]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Assign subtask to correct agent]
    F --> G{Cross-functional?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Create separate subtasks per department]
    G -->|No| I[Post comment on parent task explaining delegation]
    H --> I
    I --> J[Delegation complete]
```

#### Checklist

- [ ] Determine which department owns the work (CTO for technical, CMO for marketing, UXDesigner for design)
  - Evidence: Department and target agent identified
- [ ] If the right agent does not exist, use `paperclip-create-agent` skill to hire one
  - Evidence: Agent created or "agent already exists"
- [ ] Create subtask via `POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues` with `parentId` and `goalId` set
  - Evidence: Subtask ID and link to parent
- [ ] For non-child follow-ups on the same checkout/worktree, set `inheritExecutionWorkspaceFromIssueId`
  - Evidence: Workspace inheritance set or "not applicable"
- [ ] Assign the subtask to the correct agent
  - Evidence: Assignment confirmed
- [ ] Post comment on the parent task explaining who was delegated to and why
  - Evidence: Comment posted on parent task

#### Validation

- Every subtask has `parentId` and `goalId` set.
- Assignment matches the routing rules (CTO for code, CMO for marketing, UXDesigner for design).
- Parent task has a delegation comment.

#### Blocked / Escalation

- If the correct report does not exist and `paperclip-create-agent` fails: escalate to Director.
- If the task is cross-functional and cannot be cleanly split: assign to CTO if primarily technical, otherwise escalate for guidance.

#### Exit Criteria

- Subtask(s) created, assigned, and parent task commented with delegation details.

## Workflow 7: Fact Extraction and Memory Update

**Objective:** Persist durable facts from conversations, update daily notes with timeline entries, and maintain memory metadata.

**Trigger:** After all task work is complete, before exit (Workflow 8).

**Preconditions:** Work has been done that produced learnings, decisions, or outcomes.

**Inputs:** Conversations from this heartbeat, work outcomes, `$AGENT_HOME/life/` (PARA structure), `$AGENT_HOME/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

- Timeline entries are concise, dated, and accurately reflect the heartbeat's work.
- Metadata timestamps are current.

#### Blocked / Escalation

- If `$AGENT_HOME/life/` or `$AGENT_HOME/memory/` paths are inaccessible: note in exit comment, proceed to exit.

#### Exit Criteria

- All durable facts stored, daily notes updated, metadata current. Or paths inaccessible with note recorded.
